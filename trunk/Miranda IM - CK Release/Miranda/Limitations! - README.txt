First i'm not supporting this:

- ANSI Builds (only UNICODE) 
- MinGW Compilers
- Visual Studio Express Versions
- other Systems (only Windows)



The building environment is as follows:

* DirectX SDK 9.29.1962 (June 2010)
* Inno Setup v5.4.3 unicode
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1
* Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1


* If you are using another setup, please feel free and setup you builds, but don't blame me for supporting outdated stuff or some other crap i don't like.
