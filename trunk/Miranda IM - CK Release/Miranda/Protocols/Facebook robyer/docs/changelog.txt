Notes:

0.0.0.5
-------

- Added loading of own avatar and status message
- Added option to set Facebook "What's on my mind?" via Miranda status message system
- Better handling of own credentials (own nickname, avatar, status)
- Fixed serious mistake in Message server URL generation which caused all accounts using channels 01--09 to disconnect immediately
- Added timeout limitation + response success/error system
- Heavily optimized service of updating contacts' details + moved into separate threads to project buddy updates immediately
- Logging system improvements
- Processing improvements
- Initial translation support
- Proper logout request
- Handling of non-supported statuses -- Offline + Invisible results in Offline status, otherwise you're marked as Online
- Fix for a condition deciding whether buddy list update is needed
- Re-factorized some functions to better fit a proper object model
- Proper milliseconds time stamp for outgoing messages
- Signing off is signalized with "Connecting" icon (Experimental)
- Removed some rare HTTP User-Agents
- Editing E-mail and Password impossible when Online (Experimental)
- Simplified JSON parser entry point
- Modified memory-freeing function, should solve related rare crashes
- Fix for a crash when calling Cookies dialog (I hope)
- Logging files are now properly placed inside Miranda root only, no more mess elsewhere
- Each account now has it's own logging file
- Removed force disconnection flag for messages-updating request -- this request usually times out from time to time
- Removed unneeded new-lines from protocol logs
- 2 hidden variables: (BYTE)EnableRealLogoutSignal and (BYTE)TimeoutsLimit

Notes:
- You'll have to delete all your contacts and let them reload (or at least delete their DB "RealName" values or rename them to "Nick"), otherwise contacts will stay unnamed in the CL - the names weren't handled 100% correctly, the same as unique user identification.
- Own avatar is now handled and processed, so it's visible where possible (tabSRMM, inside Tipper when hovering account icon in statusbar, ...)
- Real names updating option has gone from now as contact's RealName/Nick value is updated normally, if you want anyone to have custom name, you can edit it like elsewhere (clist module stores this elsewhere and prioritizes this value before others)

Known issues:
- [FIXED] 100% CPU usage issue

0.0.0.4
-------

- Finally reached persistent connection - silent session refresh + periodical reconnect like original web client - although the connection may fall down, restrictive politics will disconnect when any error occurs (mostly server time-out)
- Redesigned session control to fit original web client
- Raised default update loop poll rate to 24 seconds - less traffic, optimal processing load side by side with message loop, which has poll rate of 55 seconds when not active
- Work-around for last protocol change (not receiving status message with periodical updates) by loading mobile profile page to get the data (maybe usable for other user details in future)
- Rewritten update process to request only changes since last check for updates - minimal traffic, noticefuly reduced processing load
- Completely rewritten contacts handling - this solves a) avatar flickering b) updating status, real name and idle flag too often
- Fixed reloading avatar when not needed
- Parsing improvements (solves many issues like buffer overruns/overflows)
- Fixed leak of User-Agent strings
- Better handling of garbage collecting on shutdown
- Possibility to see actual cookies via Options dialog
- Optional toggling of logging (default off)
- Extra icon for "Mind" function
- Light performance improvements in getting data from results
- More sophisticated logging system

Known issues:

- [FIXED] Status messages may contain HTML character entities for some specific characters
- [FIXED] Protocol is signed off each time server times out -- will be changed in next version, disconnecting only when connection is down (more exactly when reaching 3 time-outs, while error increments time-out counter, success decrements -- cheap, but working solution)
- [FIXED] Accounts linked with message servers 0.channel01--0.channel09 can't connect for more than just a few seconds followed by possible crash because of my beginner's bug in URL generation causing fake connection time-out

0.0.0.3
-------

- Removed some unneeded code
- Added an option to change user-agent (if FB would ever like to block us, hahah xD)
- Fixed message server URL "virginity" flag :))

Known issues:

0.0.0.2
-------

- Fixed JSON parsing issues, now data change should be OK
- Repaired timestamps for outgoing messages
- Added "Clear" option in Mind dialog (when no Mind status filled in)

- Fixed Updater support (I hope :))
- Poll rate customization
- Implemented idle/away, but not working on the server :/
- Improvements in a logging system
- Some code reorganization, mainly making some processing safe
- More pretty code management

Known issues:

- [FIXED] Crash is invoked when receiving typing notification from FB with no message followed in a "packet" (both events use similar format => bad exception for non-message content leading to buffer overrun)
- [FIXED] Plugin doesn't detect when the connection is closed/logged out remotely (rarely, but may happen, may bring some crash)
- [FIXED] Avatars may flicker, their updating process hasn't been optimized, yet

0.0.0.1
-------

- Working avatars
- Improvements to JSON parsing, still needs pretty enhancements
- Introducing smart-like logging
- Many code management changes
- Checked all dialogs validity
- Bringing some basic options to work

0.0.0.0
-------

Private initial release

All-time Issues
---------------

- Nothing, yet :)

All-time Not-issues
-------------------

- Status messages are not set properly when you set them to often - server limit requires captcha confirmation when you flood
- Being often disconnected - server fault, trying to find a work-around, but that's not easy - pidgin-facebookchat reports same thing
- Away status as is not applicable, FB doesn't support any active/controllable Away status, only server-driven Idle.
