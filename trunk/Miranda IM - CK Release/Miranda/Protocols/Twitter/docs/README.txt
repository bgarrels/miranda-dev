Miranda-Twitter
---------------

Warning! I'm not maintaining this code anymore! It's still around for people who
want to work on it, but that's it; I make no promises that it even works
(indeed, without updates, it almost certainly won't pass Twitter's auth).

To compile this code, you'll want to check out the Miranda IM header files and
install them into <source>\miranda:
<https://miranda.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/miranda/trunk/miranda/include>
