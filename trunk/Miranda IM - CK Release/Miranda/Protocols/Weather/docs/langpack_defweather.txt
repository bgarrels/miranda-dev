Plugins-included: Weather Protocol

; Weather protocol v0.3+ use this to assignment icon to weather condition
; This file is just a sample, the weather protocol will function properly without file
; if internal icon selection is turn on.  If internal icon selection is off, these
; translation strings must present (in any desired language) in order for the plugin
; to function properly.  Otherwise, NA will be set for all weather stations.

; The format of this is similar to the other language pack string, using
;   [# Weather <status> <counter> #]
; The protocol will read all string with counter = 1 until the first unavailable string
;   ie. the translated string is the same as the original string.
; The priority of the condition icons is:
;   Lightning, Fog, Snow Shower, Snow, Rain Shower, Rain, Partly Cloudy, Cloudy, Sunny
; Weather protocol will assign the icon if part of the string patches.  If no match found,
; an NA icon is assigned for that station.
; String of all languages can be added so the icon can display properly even if the raw
; data is in some language other than English.
