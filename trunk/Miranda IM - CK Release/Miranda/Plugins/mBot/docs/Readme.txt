Building MSP isn't as easy as you might expected. You need to collect following things:

-) PHP source code (www.php.net)
-) PHP development library (www.php.net - windows binaries)
-) MSVS 2005
-) Miranda-IM headers

Then you must set the paths in the MSP and LIBPHP projects so that they point to the right headers/libraries locations.
