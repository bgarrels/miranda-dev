Custom profile folders v.0.1.5.4
Copyright © 2005-2010 Cristian Libotean

This plugin allows users to select the folders where plugins save their data.
It's a service plugin, it adds no functionality on it's own.
See the included m_folders.h for help on how to make use of these services in your own plugins.
Don't forget to click apply to allow the plugin to create the folder structure.
When you click apply it will try to delete the old path (all the empty folders) and
then create the new structure.
!!! Make sure you don't have any of those folders open in explorer or any other program.
The plugin also allows environment variables to be used. Environment variables
are expanded before any miranda variables are expanded so if you have, for example, %profile_path%
defined as a system variable it will use that value instead expanding to miranda's profile path.

version 0.1.5.4 - 2011/04/14
	* Patch from Kirill Volinsky - Fixed Folders debug service (it's for testing purposes)

Version 0.1.5.3 - 2010/11/01
	* Applied patch from IG_Vasilich - unicode dialogs

Version 0.1.5.2 - 2010/11/01
	! Attempt to fix crash with Utils_ReplaceVarsW function.

Version 0.1.5.1 - 2010/08/02
	! Fixed path retrieval - the path will no longer contain any trailing \ (as the help file suggests)
	! In previous versions Folders plugin did not remove spaces and \ although the help file said it did, but now they are removed.

Version 0.1.5.0 - 2010/05/19
	+ Added support for Variables plugin.
	+ Added support for Miranda core variables.
	* Environment variables are no longer expanded by Folders plugin, instead it relies on the core to expand these variables.
	+ The fields defined in Variables plugin are the first to get parsed, then the core variables and only after all these have been expanded will
	Folders plugin expand the fields it defines itself (if they still need to be expanded) (Variables plugin -> Core -> Folders -> result).

Version 0.1.4.5 - 2009/11/13

Version 0.1.4.0 - 2007/04/23
	*Translation support for help text.

	instead	of expanding to miranda's profile path.

Version 0.1.3.0 - 2007/04/11

Version 0.1.0.1 - 2006/08/15
	*Modified m_folders.h so it compiles with C.
	+Modified helper functions so they use PATH_TOABSOLUTE when folders plugin is not installed. This should make the helper functions always return an absolute path.

	+Fixed a bug with register path service - i wasn't following my own doc

Version 0.0.0.6 - 2006/2/14:
	+Changed the api (again). Unicode paths are now possible. The unicode part doesn't work yet and maybe
	it never will - there are no *unicode* services to get the current profile path.
	*Removed support for API from version 0.0.0.3. Only 0.0.0.6 API works now ...
	+Added an event ME_FOLDERS_PATH_CHANGED.
	+If the old directory isn't empty when changing a path then 2 explorer
	windows will be opened, one for the old path and one for the new one,
	so the user can copy the data.

	+Rebased the dll (0x2F010000)
	+Added the changes made by pescuma

	*Api changes (sorry). Every entry now belongs
	to a section. The old api (from version 0.0.0.3)
	still works and folders registered with the old 
	api will be put in section "Unknown".
	+Plugin will try to delete old path structure when
	a new one is entered.
	+Plugin will try to create the new path structure if
	it doesn't exist.
	*Minor cosmetic fixes

Version 0.0.0.3 - 2005/12/17:
	*Path string is trimmed now.
	*Now it removes the last \ from the input
	edit (if there was one)
	*Added more information about variables.

Version 0.0.0.2 - 2005/12/17:
	*Changed the api, no loger requires defines for common folders.
	+Plugins can now register their folders using the new api.
	+Added options page to allow users to modify the folders.
	
	This plugin still needs testing; i've done some testing
	myself but i'm not sure it won't bork the results on some
	weird cases. Please report any bugs you find on miranda's forum.
	
version 0.0.0.1 - 2005/12/16:
	First release ...
