1. How to use?
--------------------

Import settings from Autoexec_PackUpdater.ini to profile and for server (file1.ini) are in Tamplates folder. Probably full langpack in this folder too.

1. Add in your langpack_*.txt strings needed for plugin.

Variables in Autoexec_PackUpdater.ini:

	FileCount - number of files for witch needs to check updates. Plugin supports checking for several files, but most time is only one (Pack setup file)
	
	AutoUpdate - Check updates automatically with Miranda startup. configured in Events->Pack updates

	File_VersionURL - URL where saved file with infirmation about versions of all files (file1.ini)

[File_x_] (where x - serial number file, begining from 1)
		
	CurrentVersion - sets 1.0.0 (or another what you wants) and don't change any more
	
	LastVersion - the same


3. Create file with infirmation about versions (file1.ini). One for all checked files


Options of file1.ini:

Handle [FileInfo_õ], where õ - serial number file, begining from 1 (must be equal with number in profile)


FileVersion - Current file version (Version of new pack file)

Message - Description that user see when plugin found new version

DownloadURL - URL of Update file

DiskFileName - Name of file saved on user computer.

FileType - type of file. Defines final destination of file. (1 - pack, 2 - plugin (will be installed into Plugins), 3 - icon (will be installed into Icons), 4 - files in miranda root (e.g. langpack, dbtool))

Descr - description witch shows in update list.

InfoURL - Optional. If it writed, message box that user see have button "See information", click on it open this URL.

AdvFolder - Optional. If it writed, set subfolder in folder defined FileType.


4. Download file with infirmation and updates on server.


--------------------
2. How it works?
--------------------

Plugin has two modes: silent and normal. silent is used when checking for updates on startup, normal - click menu item.
First, plugin downloads file version information and compares the "local" (File_x_CurrentVersion from profile) version with the "remote" 
(FileVersion). If they differ, that:
a). When you work in silent mode plugin checks the value LastVersion and if it differs from the FileVersion, shows the message about the update.
if not - there are no messages.
b). When working in normal mode plugin displays a message in any case.
If a user downloaded the update, but decided it just did not install, update is still considered to be established.
