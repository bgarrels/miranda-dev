=======================================================

Hello there, I'm happy you are trying out my OSD plugin... I've just started
to make it (in fact, it's the first miranda plugin i ever made ;-) so please
excuse bugs etc. (but you may report them, of course ;-)

The plugin is trying to implement all the functionality of the 'old' OSD plugin.
However, I never got to it's documentation, so I can't tell if everything's gonna
work the way it should... Let me know :o)

And I'll be happy if you send some suggestions/code parts etc., but please,
send it into the forum of this project on miranda's web ;-)



------| Short tips: |----------------------------------

Moving the OSD:
Simply drag it by pressing left mouse button and then move the cursor ;-)
Note that only position changes done while settings dialog is shown are
saved.

Closing the actual OSD:
Press the right button over the OSD - that will close the OSD and
show a message window for the contact who caused the OSD activity.
