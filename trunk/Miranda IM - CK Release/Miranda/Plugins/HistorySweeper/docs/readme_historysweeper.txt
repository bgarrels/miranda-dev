"UNSAFE mode" and perfomance
----------------------------
Miranda IM DevTeam says:
"Miranda's database is normally protected against corruption by agressively 
flushing data to the disk on writes. ("Safe mode") If you're doing a lot of writes 
(eg in an import plugin) it can sometimes be desirable to switch this feature off 
to speed up the process. If you do switch it off, you must remember that crashes are far 
more likely to be catastrophic, so switch it back on at the earliest possible opportunity."

"Use UNSAFE mode" switch affected ONLY to Histroy Sweeper plugin and switched off by default.
