Licensing terms could be found below.


Installation Instructions
=========================
Extract the zip file in the Miranda home directory. This will create a directory
'Smileys' with the default smiley pack. And the smileyadd.dll will go in the
plugins directory. 
Or you can copy this by hand from the archive. Note: to make the default work,
the default smiley pack HAS to be in the 'Smileys' directory.

GDI+ installation required to use non icon smiley packs
GDI+ come pre-installed on Windows XP, Office XP and later, for everybody else you can get it here: 
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6a63ab9c-df12-4d41-933c-be590feaa05a&DisplayLang=en


Smiley Packs
================
SmileyAdd supports *.msl, *.asl and *.xep Smiley Packs.
For syntax of in *.msl or *.asl files check the example file "smileyadd_example_libfile.msl".

Note SmileyAdd provide better validation for malformed Regular Expressions then nConvers. 
As a result some Smiley Packs working under nConvers will give errors under SmileyAdd. 
Although if these errors are fixed resulting Smiley Pack will work correctly under both plugins.

Pre-packaged Smiley Packs could be found here:
http://addons.miranda-im.org/index.php?action=display&id=41

Any Smiley Pack from SmileyAdd, IEView or nConvers sections is usable with SmileyAdd

Per Contact Smiley Packs
========================
At first you need to create custom smiley category. To do that type the name of the new category 
into the text input field in Smiley Category part of option dialog and press "+".
Now you can select this new Smiley Category for the contact. You need to right click on the 
contact select "Assign Smiley Category" and then select from the menu appeared category you want. 
To delete custom Smiley Category select in in the list in option dialog and press "-".

Limitations
===========
Non Unicode version does not support DBCS characters in smiley codes and file names. 
DBCS character sets are Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. 
It's recommended to use Unicode version in this case.

For true Unicode operation of Unicode SmileyAdd Unicode Smiley Packs required

SmileyAdd will work only with Miranda 0.6 or later. 
Unicode SmileyAdd will only work with Unicode Miranda and 
Windows 2000 or later.

GIF with "Disposal method" "To Previous" not supported

When SmileyAdd is used with IEView only smiley packs with each smiley stored 
in separate image file (phg, gif, ico, jpg, etc.) could be used

Bugs
====
No guarantees, but probably there are some bugs. If you find something, and would 
like to see this fixed then post on the Miranda forum as detailed as possible report 
on the bug (version numbers, OS, how to reproduce it) and I will get back on that.

Developers
==========
There is also some smiley support for plugins... There is something remotely 
resembling documentation in "m_smileyadd.h". Contact me if you have questions. 
At this moment you can: 
    - replace smileys in a RichEdit with only supplying the RichEdit handle
    - retrieve an icon by supplying the emoticon text, i.e. ":)"
    - parse text and retrieve icons for each emoticon found
    - show a smiley select window
    - contact me if you need more support (see the developer.txt also)

- MatriX       For helping out with the icons and other stuff!
