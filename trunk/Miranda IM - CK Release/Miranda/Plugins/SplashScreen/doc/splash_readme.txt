Version history:

0.1.2.2 beta
[-] Crash fix by George Hazan

0.1.2.1 beta
[-] Fixed: wrong absolute path was used for preview
[-] Fixed: preview function completely stops working when closing splash by right click (thx m0003r)
[-] Enabled and fixed tab navigation in options
[*] Updated langpack

0.1.2.0 beta
[!] Switched to advaimg.dll for processing pngs, png2dib is not used anymore
[+] Plugin API changes: added uuid (C64CC8E0-CF03-474A-8B11-8BD4565CC) and MIID_SPLASHSCREEN interface (91CB1E8D-C33C-43C0-BDD8-6725B070B3E0)
[+] Added an option to show Miranda version on splash (more options to be implemented)
[+] Added environment variables support (%PROFILEPATH%, %APPDATA%, etc.)
[+] Added Ini param to point to config file (aware of environment variables support, thus makes possible to use different ini-es for different profiles)
[*] Removed mp3 support (was too buggy, will reimplement eventually)
[*] When random feature is enabled file name is omitted from path when selecting a new file

0.1.1.7 beta
[+] Experimental mp3 playback support

[*] Redesigned options page a bit
[*] Langpack changes
[*] Alot of other changes, reorganizations and fixes

0.1.1.6 beta
[-] Fixed "Display time" option. Now should be really working. If you want splash to be closed after Miranda fully loaded set it to 0
[-] Fixed: sometimes splash wasn't autoclosed with TimeToShow = 0
[*] Display time option can accept values up to 20000 mseconds
[*] Dinamically linked build is removed from archive to avoid cluttering of miranda root folder when using Updater.
[*] Code cleanup

0.1.1.5 beta
[+] Updater support for betas (don't forget to enable "Use beta?" option in Updater settings)
[+] Dinamically linked build (you'll need MSVCR71.dll to run it)

[*] Added third state to PlaySound checkbox in options. Means not to follow global sound state
[*] Reduced dll size due to switch to VS2003
[-] Some other minor fixes
